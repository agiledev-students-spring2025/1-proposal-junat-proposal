## What and Why?  
HydroForest is a **web app** designed to help users **track their daily water intake** while making hydration a fun and rewarding experience. Every time a user logs a bottle of water, they **grow a virtual tree** in their digital forest. Over time, consistent hydration leads to a **lush and thriving forest**.  

This app addresses the problem of **inconsistent water intake**, which can lead to dehydration, fatigue, and other health issues. By **gamifying** the experience and providing a **visual representation of progress**, HydroForest encourages users to **build healthy habits** while enjoying a growing digital ecosystem.  

## For Whom?  
HydroForest is designed for:  
- **Health-conscious individuals** looking to stay hydrated.  
- **Gamification enthusiasts** who enjoy tracking progress through visual rewards.  
- **Students and professionals** who often forget to drink water during busy schedules.  
- **Anyone who wants a fun, interactive way to build better hydration habits.**  

By making hydration a **rewarding** and **engaging** experience, HydroForest caters to a **wide audience** who struggles with maintaining consistent water intake.  

## How?  
From an end-user perspective, HydroForest will:  
1. **Allow users to log their daily water intake** (e.g., one bottle = one tree growth).  
2. **Visually represent their progress** by growing a virtual tree for each bottle consumed.  
3. **Track historical hydration data** to show trends over time.  
4. **Gamify the experience** by letting users build and customize their own forest.  
5. **Send reminders and notifications** to encourage users to stay hydrated.  

### Optional Future Features:  
- **Social Sharing** - Share forest progress with friends.  
- **Social and competitive gamification** 
    - **Leaderboards**: Compete with friends for the healthiest forest
    - **Friend Challenges**: Ex. Drink 8 glasses today and unlock a Sakura tree!
- **Real World Impact**: Plant Real Trees! Every 500 bottles logged contributes to a real tree planted via partnerships with environmental NGOs.

### Scope
HydroForest is a great project for a team of 4–6 students to complete in one semester. The main features—tracking water intake, growing a virtual forest, and adding gamification, are doable using tools like React and Firebase. If needed, we can adjust the scope by adding or simplifying features, like social sharing or real-world tree planting, depending on how complex things get. By following an Agile approach, we can focus on building the core functionality first and then improve it over time, making sure we have a fun and engaging app by the end of the semester.
