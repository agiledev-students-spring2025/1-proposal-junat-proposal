# Project Proposal

# HydroForest - Grow Trees by Drinking Water

## What and Why?  
HydroForest is a **web app** designed to help users **track their daily water intake** while making hydration a fun and rewarding experience. Every time a user logs a bottle of water, they **grow a virtual tree** in their digital forest. Over time, consistent hydration leads to a **lush and thriving forest**.  

This app addresses the problem of **inconsistent water intake**, which can lead to dehydration, fatigue, and other health issues. By **gamifying** the experience and providing a **visual representation of progress**, HydroForest encourages users to **build healthy habits** while enjoying a growing digital ecosystem.  

## For Whom?  
HydroForest is designed for:  
- **Health-conscious individuals** looking to stay hydrated.  
- **Gamification enthusiasts** who enjoy tracking progress through visual rewards.  
- **Students and professionals** who often forget to drink water during busy schedules.  
- **Anyone who wants a fun, interactive way to build better hydration habits.**  

By making hydration a **rewarding** and **engaging** experience, HydroForest caters to a **wide audience** who struggles with maintaining consistent water intake.  

## How?  
From an end-user perspective, HydroForest will:  
1. **Allow users to log their daily water intake** (e.g., one bottle = one tree growth).  
2. **Visually represent their progress** by growing a virtual tree for each bottle consumed.  
3. **Track historical hydration data** to show trends over time.  
4. **Gamify the experience** by letting users build and customize their own forest.  
5. **Send reminders and notifications** to encourage users to stay hydrated.  

### Optional Future Features:  
- **Social Sharing** - Share forest progress with friends.  
- **Real-world Impact** - Partner with tree-planting organizations for milestones.  
- **Customizable Themes** - Different forest environments based on progress.  

## Scope  
This project is **well-balanced** for a semester-long development cycle with **4-6 developers**.  
- **Moderate complexity**: Tracking water intake and visualizing tree growth is achievable.  
- **Challenges include** implementing animations and UI design for tree growth.  
- **Possible integrations**: Basic analytics, notifications, and gamification mechanics.  
- **Scalable**: The project can start simple (basic tracking + visuals) and expand with additional features over time.  

This ensures that HydroForest is **challenging enough** to be engaging but **not overly complex**, making it a **realistic and rewarding** project for a semester. ðŸš€ðŸŒ±
